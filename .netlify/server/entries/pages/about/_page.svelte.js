I am a software engineer by profession -- <b>Android Engineer</b>.</p> <p class="text-justify text-lg">I was fortunate to be born in the era characterised by accelerated
		technological development at the appropriate place to experience the rich
		behavioural change. This induced a great amount of interest in tech and
		specifically computer softwares.</p> <p class="mt-4 text-justify text-lg">Iâ€™ve worked for multiple small scale businesses to help them grow with the
		help of software technology. Free and Open Source Software always piques my
		curiosity, and I try to contribute as much as I can. Following that, I led
		the development of personal finance and investment analysis tools and the
		creation of a social media platform for investors at <a class="underline text-blue-700 dark:text-blue-400" href="https://www.tickertape.in/" target="_blank">Tickertape</a> in the fintech sector.</p> <p class="mt-4 text-justify text-lg">At the present time, I contribute to <a class="underline text-blue-700 dark:text-blue-400" href="https://www.jiocinema.com/" target="_blank">JioCinema</a> one of India&#39;s premier OTT platforms. Primarily towards the development and
		enhancement of the Android Application.</p> <p class="mt-4 text-justify text-lg">More on my personal side of life: I like to take up challenges. And I
		consistently try to push myself in all aspects of my life. I spend most of
		my time building stuff, geeking around computers, listening to music,
		reading and questioning different philosophies around my daily life. I also
		play football, swim, run, cycle and lift dead heavy weights regularly. In
		the process, I struggle to study about human body to better recover/prevent
		injuries and incorporate healthy-lifestyle.</p> <p class="mt-4 text-justify text-lg mb-14">Exciting project / idea / general conversation? feel free to send a message: <a class="underline text-blue-700 dark:text-blue-400" href="${"https://twitter.com/messages/compose?recipient_id=" + escape(704722666188505100, true)}" target="_blank">Twitter</a>
