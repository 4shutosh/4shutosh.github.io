			I am a software engineer by profession — <b>Android Engineer</b>.
		</p>

		<p class="text-justify text-lg">
			I was fortunate to be born in the era characterised by accelerated technological development
			and appropriate place to experience the rich behavioural change. This induced a great amount
			of interest in tech and specifically computer softwares.
		</p>

		<p class="mt-4 text-justify text-lg">
			I’ve worked for multiple small scale businesses to help them grow with the help of software
			technology. Free and Open Source Software always piques my curiosity, and I try to contribute
			as much as I can. Previously, I worked in the peak EdTech sector as a software engineer. Now I
			work for <a

				href="https://www.tickertape.in/"
				target="_blank">Tickertape</a
			> as an Android developer in the fintech space.
		</p>

		<p class="mt-4 text-justify text-lg">
			The other aspects I’m most interested in are <b>Finance</b> and <b>Human Psychology</b>.
			<br />Both of them intrigue me and I (try to) study about them constantly. (As of now)
			Combined tech, finance, and human psychology is the ideal career path for me.
		</p>

		<p class="mt-4 text-justify text-lg">
			More on my personal side of life: I like to take up challenges in life. And I consistently try
			to push myself in all aspects of my life. I spend most of my time building stuff, geeking
			around computers, listening to music, reading and questioning different aspects around my
			daily life. I consider myself to be a fitness enthusiast. I play football, swim, run, cycle
			and lift dead heavy weights regularly. In the process, I also study about human body to better
			recover/prevent injuries and incorporate healthy-lifestyle.
