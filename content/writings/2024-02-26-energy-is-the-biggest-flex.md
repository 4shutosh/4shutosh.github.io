description: Importance of Energy

Energy is the capacity to do work. Everything we do—any action, physical or mental—whether it be talking, reading these words, or processing the world around you through the sensory organs, the perpetual mental chatter is all a process of energy breakdown and conversion.

> Energy, not time, is the fundamental currency of high performance.

The 4 variables which affect our performance levels are, by [Dr. Jim Loehr](https://g.co/kgs/dRCH4iw):

- **Physical** - _the quantity of our energy_
- **Emotional** - _the quality of our energy_
- **Mental** - _the focus of our energy_
- **Spiritual** - _the force of our energy_

Consistently having a higher energy level is an easy edge to have. The opportunities unlocked by having high energy are amazing, and creates a positive chain reaction.

##### The most fundamental source of energy is physical; the most significant is spiritual.

Some simple yet effective ways to optimise for high energy levels are:

- Physical Energy:
  - Eat Sufficiently Healthy
    - Do not starve, eat healthy. Rule of thumb: The more processed the food, the unhealthier it becomes.
  - Hydration (electrolytes: salts + sugar)
  - Get enough sunlight
  - Exercise
    - Keep your body moving
  - Adequate sleep
  - No stimulants (limited coffee, no smoking and alcohol)
- Emotional
  - Socialise
  - Practice gratitude
  - Being aware of the emotions and seeking positive ones rather than negative emotions.
- Mental
  - Appropriate mindset, optimism and focus at the current work at hand
- Spiritual
  - Knowing the purpose behind the things & goals that you want to achieve + being aligned and authentic with your values

High-energy individuals are contagious and bring a lively, enjoyable vibe to their surroundings. Keep up the energy!
